				<h2>About Me</h2>
				<p>
					I am currently a sophomore at USC, and my major is
					biology with a minor in psychology. I am from Louisiana originally. I have enjoyed going to college out of state, and it has helped me become more independent and confident in myself. I enjoy reading, watching movies, and hanging out with my friends in my free time. 
					
				</p>
				<p id="more" class= "hidden">
					Outside of school, I participate in many 
					extracurriculars. I am in Alpha Gamma Delta, a social sorority on campus. I have also recently joined Alpha Epsilon Delta, which is a pre-health fraternity that offers many professional development opportunities to help me on my future path. I was on council for Relay for Life this past year, and I am on the club beach volleyball team.

				<h2>My Future Career Plans</h2>
				<p>
					After graduation, I plan on taking a semester or a year off to work and gain experince in the field of physical therapy. I will apply to physical therapy programs in South and North Carolina and probably a few in other states as well. PT school will be another two and a half to three years post graduation. 
				</p>
				<p>
				<p id="more-2" class= "hidden">
					Once I complete PT school, I hope to become a physical therapist for a sports team. I would prefer to be able to work with multiple different sports, so being a physical therapist for a college program would be ideal. I have played volleyball my whole life and always loved learning about how the body works and ways to improve, so I can't wait to be able to help others heal from injuries or learn how to best prevent them.
